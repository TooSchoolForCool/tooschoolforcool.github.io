I am a research scientist in the National Key Laboratory of General Artificial Intelligence at [Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI)](https://www.bigai.ai/), working on building intelligent robot system that can understand and interact with the world.

I received a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from UCLA in 2022, where I was a member of the [Center for Vision, Cognition, Learning, and Autonomy (VCLA)](https://communitypartnerships.ucla.edu/program/center-vision-cognition-learning-and-autonomy-vcla/), advised by [Prof. Song-Chun Zhu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/index.html). My work at UCLA was supported by DARPA XAI, ONR MURI, and ONR Cognitive Robot.

Before coming to UCLA, I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from Hunan University in 2017.
